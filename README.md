Great, Nemanja, I just reviewed the CV, the next step is to complete an interview.
I invite you to complete our asynchronous interviews to assess different aspects of your profile:

It is important that you are very detailed in your responses, as they will be evaluated by our team of reviewers. Completing the interview will take between 10 and 15 minutes, depending on the length of your answers. We use this assessment method to streamline the process and share your evaluation with the Recruiter Engineer and the C-level team, shortening the steps of the process
